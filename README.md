#  Kafka Concurrency Testing Project
## Overview
This project is designed to test and evaluate Kafka's concurrency capabilities by leveraging industry best practices. The primary objective is to explore Kafka's performance and reliability in handling concurrent operations, ensuring robust message processing in distributed systems.

## Features
Concurrency Testing: Assess Kafka's ability to handle multiple producers and consumers operating simultaneously.
Best Practices Implementation: Adhere to industry-standard practices for Kafka configuration and usage.
Performance Benchmarking: Measure key metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization.
Fault Tolerance: Simulate scenarios like message retries, offsets management, and consumer group coordination.
